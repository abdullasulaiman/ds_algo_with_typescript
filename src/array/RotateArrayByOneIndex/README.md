# Inteview Questions : Right Rotate the Array by One Index
## Given an array, can you rotate its elements once from right to left? Implement your solution in Javascript and see if your code runs successfully!

### Problem Statement
In this problem, you have to implement the  rotateArray(arr:Array<number>):void function which will pick the last index from the right and rotate it to the left. This means that the right-most element will appear at the left-most position in the array, and so on. However, in this problem, you only have to rotate by one element from the right.

### Function Prototype
```
const rotateArray(Array<number>):void
```

### Output
Array rotated by one element from right to left

### Sample Input
```
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
```

### Sample Output
```
arr = [ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1 ]
```
